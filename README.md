### A bitrrex app that shows the overall value of a wallet

The plan for this app is to manage `shitcoinitis`. This means that it should
show how many coins are a surplus in a bittrex wallet when current value is
compared against total investments, on a wallet per wallet basis.

The main features per wallet should be:

 1. Current value in BTC / USD
 2. Quantity of coins that are surplus/deficit
 3. Measure gain/loss by:
   - last 30 minutes
   - last hour
   - last 3 hours
   - last 24 hours
   - total

Mockup of UI to come. Please use `issues` for any suggestions etc.

### installation

First get `nodeJS` installed. Use an `nvm`.

then:
```bash
npm install
```

then
```
npm start
```
